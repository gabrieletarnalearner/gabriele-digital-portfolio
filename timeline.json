For a long time, a child's toothbrush was like a mini version of a regular toothbrush. Turns out the dimensions made it rather complicated for children both to grip it and use it correctly! Once an ergonomic brush with a larger handle was designed, it became a bestseller. A study of behavior was essential in this case.","tags":["design","children","ideas"]},{"id":"id_mh3f3d8qogmh95","date":"2025-10-21","title":"Design pass","text":"Chose colors, built base components.","tags":["design"]}]
